      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am an Embedded Software Engineer by profession, a Mechanical Engineer by education, and a curious tinkerer by hobby. I have a wide range of interests and decided to use this site as a central hub to document everything I work on. I&amp;rsquo;m not entirely sure what this will evolve into, but for now, it&amp;rsquo;s a fun project to track my endeavors as the new year kicks off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;education&#34;&gt;Education&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://austinguevara.com/imgs/bio/graduation.jpg#center&#34; alt=&#34;graduation pic&#34; width=&#34;250&#34; height=&#34;300&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From 2016 to 2021, I attended Virginia Tech, where I earned a BS in Mechanical Engineering. During that time, I developed an interest in computer science and managed to take a few introductory courses on the subject. My initial goal was to pursue a career in robotics, which led me to participate in undergraduate research with the &lt;a href=&#34;https://faser.me.vt.edu/&#34;&gt;FASER Lab&lt;/a&gt;.  Under the supervision of Dr. Komendera and the graduate students in the lab, I was exposed to a wealth of knowledge far beyond what I had learned in class. This experience not only broadened my understanding but also made me realize how much there was still left to learn.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-did-i-start-this&#34;&gt;Why did I start this?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I blame this entire journey on two people: Beau and Chris. As 2024 came to an end, I decided to focus on improving my coding skills. For the first time ever, I participated in &lt;a href=&#34;https://adventofcode.com/&#34;&gt;Advent of Code&lt;/a&gt; and to make it even more challenging, I completed it entirely in a language that was completely new to meâ€”Zig.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; This sparked a series of tangents, including learning RayLib, attempting to create a browser-based game, and eventually diving into Go to build an HTTP server.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
