## Why did I start this?

Honestly, this whole thing can be blamed on two people; Beau and Chris.  For some reason as 2024 came to an end I decided to work on my coding skills.  For the first time ever I attempted [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) and if that wasn't hard enough I did it all in a langauage completly new to me, Zig.[^1] This led me on a tangent of learning RayLib, trying to make a game for the browser, then finally learning Go to make an HTTP server.

While going down this rabit hole of learning I also was finally downloading Letterboxd to begin recording my opinion on every movie I watched.  Our household has taken a liking to GoodReads and now that I was a proud AMC A-List member I was hoping to take that over to my movie watching for the New Years.  This is when Beau, my roomate, suggested that since I enjoyed sharing my oppinions so much I should just start a blog.  Then, when I told my friend Chris of this potential new project, he said it would be an easy project to learn a little web dev... with all that said here I am ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.

## Where to begin



[^1]: Advent of Code was an extremly fun experince and I will probably do a series of posts deticated to these puzzles
