## What is Advent of Code?
Advent of Code is a series of programming puzzles created by [Eric Wastl](https://was.tl/) that come out every year in December. Everything you need to know can be found on the official [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2025/about) page, but to simplify: every day a two-part puzzle is released. You can only access part two after completing part one. Every person receives a unique input, so no two answers should be exactly the same. Other than that, there are no real rules—it’s simply about thinking through a fun (and sometimes annoying) problem until you arrive at a solution.

This year (2025), there have been some changes to the format. First, instead of 25 days of puzzles, there will only be 12. Second, the global leaderboard has been removed from the site.

## Why do Advent of Code?
There are no prizes for completing the daily puzzles. It’s not like LeetCode or HackerRank, where you might encounter similar questions in a coding interview. And with the global leaderboard removed this year, there aren’t even bragging rights for solving a puzzle the fastest.

For me, I participate for two main reasons. At work, I tend to use the same tools all the time and rarely get an excuse to try something new. For a while now, I’ve had my eye on a programming language called Zig, and these puzzles provide a great opportunity to experiment with a language I’m not familiar with.

The second reason is simply that I enjoy puzzles. My wife loves jigsaw puzzles and can work on them all day—I can’t. My favorite part is when she hands me a single piece she can’t place and asks me to figure out where it goes. I enjoy small, difficult problems, which is why the daily release format of Advent of Code is perfect for me.

## General Information
As mentioned earlier, the format is pretty straightforward, so even before jumping into the first puzzle we can outline some general expectations. Each day, starting December 1st and ending December 12th, a two-part puzzle will be released. The puzzles always include a goofy meta-narrative about how solving them will help save Christmas, but the core format is consistent.

We are given an input file and specific instructions on what to do with that input in order to compute the correct answer. After entering the answer, we’re told whether it is correct. If it is, we gain access to part two. Part two is typically an extension of part one, and depending on your initial solution approach, it can either be trivial or significantly more challenging.
