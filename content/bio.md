I am an Embedded Software Engineer by trade, a Mechanical Engineer by degree, and a less than average tinkerer by hobby.  I have plenty of hobbies and figured I would use this site as a catchall where I can document everything I do.  I'm not quite sure what this will become but for now it is a fun project to keep track of what I do as the new year begins.

## Education

From 2016 - 2021 I attended Virginia Tech where I recieved a BS in Mechnical Engineering.  During my time I managed to take sprinkle in some beginner Computer Science classes as I gained an intrest on the topic.  My inital goal was in pursuit of the robotics field and due to this I participated in under-grad research for [FASER Lab](https://faser.me.vt.edu/).  Under the sueprvision of Dr. Komendera and the grad students in the Lab I quickly got introduced to so much more than I had yet to learn in any class and simultaneously realized how much I still had to learn.

A major part of the M.E. curriculum was the capstone project during your final year.  The goal of my project was to test the impact and functionlaity a 5th appendage could add to a quadruped robot, specifically in the concern of stability (*we added a tail to a robot dog*).  I was voted the leader for our team and was the sole software developer.  It was difficult but I am extremly happy that in the span of one academic year we were able to design, build, and test a quadruped with an extra linkage that future teams can use in experiments.

## Professional Experince
1) **Student Paid Researcher (2019 - 2021)**

I am part of the unforunate generation who had to experince collge during the COVID-19 Pandemic.  Due to my connections through FASER Lab and my Mechatonics Professor I was put in contact with Dr. Joseph Meadows who I would work under to help develop a venillator substitute out of a BiPAP machine.  My role was focused around reading pressure sensors using an MSP432 and outputting the analyzed data to a python script for display.  You can read more about the project [here](https://news.vt.edu/articles/2020/04/virginia-tech-engineer-and-carilion-physician-upgrade-breathing-.html).

2) **Firmware Engineer (2021 - present)**

Post graduation I joined Instant Care Inc. who had recently been aquired by [Connect America](https://www.connectamerica.com/).  As part of a small team a lot of autonomy and trust was placed on me early on.  The devices I develop are typiclly pretty simple battery powered remote sub-Gig devices.  This allowed me to quickly become comfortable writing bare-metal code for microconrontllers to interface with various sensors and radio modules.  Recently, as we have shifted into some more complex radio protocols (Bluetooth, Zigbee, Z-Wave) I have had to learn RTOS and even some backend systems to offload data to.
